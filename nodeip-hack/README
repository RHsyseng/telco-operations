This is a way to force the internal ip in the context of a SNO with several interfaces

# 4.10+

Modify the file `[mc_410.yml](mc_410.yml)` and put any valid ip from the cidr you want to target

# previous versions

Modify the file `[mc_48.yml](mc_48.yml)` and put the cidr you want to target

This leverages a custom container we prepared that will locate the ip of the node associated to a given CIDR
