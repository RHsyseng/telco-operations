# **A first look at mirror registry**

This document provides information on how to use the new mirror-registry designed to provide a lightweight quay for disconnected use case

## **Environment**

* Any box where podman can run. We used centos8stream

## **How To use**

1. Gather the binary at [https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/file/pub/openshift-v4/clients/mirror-registry/1.0/mirror-registry.tar.gz](https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/file/pub/openshift-v4/clients/mirror-registry/1.0/mirror-registry.tar.gz) and uncompress it

```
curl -s -L https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/file/pub/openshift-v4/clients/mirror-registry/1.0/mirror-registry.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /usr/bin
```

2. Use it in a simple way

```
/usr/bin/mirror-registry install
```

This will use an autogenerated cert stored in /etc/quay-install and create a random password for the init user. You will have to use podman with insecure mode or trust said certificate in order to interact with the resulting registry

3. You can also be more specific

- REGISTRY_NAME is the fqdn of your box
- SSL_CERT is the path of a valid CA (as generated by openssl)
- SSL_KEY is the path of the corresponding ssl key

```
SSH_KEY="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
/usr/bin/mirror-registry install --quayHostname ${REGISTRY_NAME} --sslCert ${SSL_CERT} --sslKey ${SSL_KEY} --initPassword ${REGISTRY_PASSWORD} --ssh-key ${SSH_KEY}
```

4. Profit. One can validate the installation with the following command:

```
podman login -u init -p ${REGISTRY_PASSWORD} ${REGISTRY_NAME}:8443
```

## **Development**

In order to modify the registry, you will need:

- git
- make
- podman
- valid credentials for registry.redhat.io

The repository for the code of the registry is stored at [https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry](https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry) , one can create its own modified image by

- authenticating to registry.redhat.io from a valid pull secret

```
PULL_SECRET="/root/openshift_pull.json"
REDHAT_CREDS=$(cat $OPENSHIFT_PULL_JSON | jq .auths.\"registry.redhat.io\".auth -r | base64 -d)
RHN_USER=$(echo $REDHAT_CREDS | cut -d: -f1)
RHN_PASSWORD=$(echo $REDHAT_CREDS | cut -d: -f2)
podman login -u "$RHN_USER" -p "$RHN_PASSWORD" registry.redhat.io
```

- creating a tar with all the contents( the dependency images get bundled)

```
make build-online-zip
```

## **Limitations/Additional Notes**

- the command can also target a remote host, although we didnt see too much benefit to going with such approach.
- It was not possible to specify a different user than init in the first release. We opened [https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry/pull/46](https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry/pull/46) to address it, which got merged so this will be possible in an upcoming release.
- IPV6 isn't currently supported by quay. We opened [https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry/pull/47](https://github.com/quay/mirror-registry/pull/47) to address it by using a side haproxy container, but this got closed. For the time beeing, the folder [ipv6](ipv6) contains assets allowing to deploy an extra container in an ipv6 context. This can be deployed with the following instructions:

```
cp quay_haproxy.cfg /etc/quay-install/haproxy.cfg
cp quay_haproxy.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now quay-haproxy
```
