# FakeFish

> **WARNING**: The work exposed here is not supported in any way by Red Hat, this is the result of exploratory work. Use at your own risk.

`FakeFish` is a flask based app that exposes a RedFish-like API with a set of limited endpoints that allow the deployment of OpenShift nodes via the Metal3 operator on hardware that doesn't support RedFish or doesn't follow the RedFish standard.

The way it works is by running a set of scripts that interact with the hardware using vendor tools/other methods while exposing a fake RedFish API that Metal3 can query.

The [app/](./app/) directory contains the FakeFish application. Inside the `app` directory we can find the [custom_scripts](./app/custom_scripts/) folder where we will find 5 scripts:

|Script|What should it do?|
|------|----------------|
|`poweron.sh`|Power on the server|
|`poweroff.sh`|Power off the server|
|`bootfromcdonce.sh`|Set server to boot from virtual CD once|
|`mountcd.sh`|Mount the iso received in the server's virtual CD|
|`unmountcd.sh`|Unmount the iso from the server's virtual CD|

The script names can't be changed, and the scripts in the `custom_scripts` folder are just placeholders. Users need to implement their own scripts, we will not maintain/add providers to this project.

Users can take a look at the [dell_scripts](./dell_scripts/) folder where they can find the scripts we used for our testing with DELL hardware. Remember that these scripts are unsupported/unmaintained and should be taken as a reference, nothing else.

A [Containerfile](./app/Containerfile) is included, so users can build their own container image out of it. We published an image using the bits of the first release at `quay.io/mavazque/fakefish:v0`.

## Usage

You need a FakeFish process for each server you plan to install. Think of FakeFish like if it was a custom implementation of a BMC for that specific server.

Since you will be potentially running multiple FakeFish instances, you will make use of an environment variable to configure in which port a given FakeFish instance listens on. On top of that, you need to do a bind mount for the folder containing the scripts for managing that specific server.

An example can be found below:

> **NOTE**: Every container is mapped to a single BMC, but if more hosts are required, different ports can be used (9001, 9002,...)

```sh
podman run -p 9000:9000 -e PORT=9000 -v $PWD/dell_scripts:/opt/fakefish/custom_scripts:z quay.io/mavazque/fakefish:v0

sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=9000/tcp
```

Then, in the `install-config.yaml` file, it is required to specify the IP where the container is running instead of the 'real' BMC:

```yaml
bmcAddress: redfish-virtualmedia://192.168.1.10:9000/redfish/v1/Systems/1
```

## Logs

In a successful execution you should see something like this in the logs:

- Starting FakeFish

    ```sh
    $ podman run -p 9000:9000 -e PORT=9000 -v $PWD/dell_scripts:/opt/fakefish/custom_scripts:z quay.io/mavazque/fakefish:v0
